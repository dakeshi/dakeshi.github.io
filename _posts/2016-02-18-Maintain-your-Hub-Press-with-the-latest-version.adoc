How to maintain your HubPress with lastest version?

With cross compare fork feature of github, you can always use updated Hubpress.


. Click Compare button in your HubPress repository

. Change base fork to your repository. I use the master branch here. But if you want to use another branch, you can change it. For example, it would be gh-pages branch.

. Select compare across forks.
