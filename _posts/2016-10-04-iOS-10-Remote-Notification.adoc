= iOS 10 Remote Notification

In iOS 10, there are big changes in the notification. Remote and local notification methods are unified. You can add media such as image using notification extension. In this article, I will talk about how to set up notification types and register the remote notification. And I will show you how to handle remote notification and the actionable notification in the next section.

== Remote Notification Process

First, it is helpful to know about how to work remote notification. Remote notification involves the following steps: 

1. Configure your notification types and register the remote notification
2. Register remote notification to APNs
3. Register device token to your server (push notification provider)
4. Communicate between provider and APNs
5. Handle remote notifications

NOTE: step 3 and 4 are the server side process.

== configure notification types and register the remote notification

=== configure notification types

You need to request authorization for receiving notifications. In this stage, you can set up notification types such as alert, sound and badge. 

In iOS 9 and below::
use `registerUserNotificationSettings` method 

In iOS 10::
use `requestAuthorization(options:completionHandler:)` method.

[source, swift]
----
func requestAuthorization(options: UNAuthorizationOptions = [],
        completionHandler: @escaping (Bool, Error?) -> Void)
----

- `options` describe which notification types you want to provide.
- `completionHandler` has two parameters: `granted` and `error`
* `error` is nil if no error occurred.
* `granted` returns `true` or `false` depends on the following cases:

[cols="<80,^20", options="header"] 
|===
|Cases
|Return value

|Select *allow* in the authorization request dialog
|True


|Select *don't allow* in the authorization request dialog
|False

|The notification settings for the app is not enabled
|False

|The notification settings for the app is enabled but one or more authorization options are disabled 
|True
|===

It is not results what I expected. Why?

[quote, granted parameter in Apple Document]
The value of this parameter is *true* when authorization for the requested options was granted. The value is *false* when authorization for one or more of the options is denied.

They talk about requested options, not the notification setting. But the practical test results is different. It has not returned `false` value if users change authorization options in the setting app.

NOTE: Authorization request dialog appears only once when you launch your app at the first time. So, I recommend you to set up `.alert` option as a default. If you omit it from `registerUserNotificationSettings` or `requestAuthorization(options:completionHandler:)` , you could not find `.alert` option in the setting app for your app notification. 


==== register the remote notification
- call `registerForRemoteNotifications()` method.
- If the registration succeeds, it will automatically call  `application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken` delegate method. If it is failed, `application:didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError` delegate method is called.

=== sample code

[source,swift]
.appDelegate.swift
----
import UserNotifications

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?


    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    	// 1. registering notification type
        if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {
          UNUserNotificationCenter
          .current()
          .requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .sound, .badge]) {
            granted, error in

           if granted {
             debugPrint("granted")
             // 2. registering your app for remote notifications.
             application.registerForRemoteNotifications()
           } else {
            // Disable the notification service. ex) Notify to provider server.
            debugPrint("Error or nil: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "check your app notification setting in the setting app")")
          }
       } else {
            let settings = UIUserNotificationSettings(types: [.alert, .badge, .sound], categories: nil)
            // use application:didRegister delegate method to call registerForRemoteNotifications in iOS9 below 
        }        
    }
    ...
    ...
   
@available(iOS, deprecated: 10.0)
extension AppDelegate {
  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegister notificationSettings: UIUserNotificationSettings) {
    application.registerForRemoteNotifications()
  }
}

=== Register remote notifications to APNs
If you register your remote notification successfully to APNs,   

=== Handle remote notifications
- foreground

- background or the app is closed

- In iOS 10 +
* `userNotificationCenter(_:willPresent:withCompletionHandler:)` is called when the app is the foreground state 
* use `userNotificationCenter(_:didReceive:withCompletionHandler:)` to deal with actionable notifications when the app is the background or closed state.

- custom actions
